# Flyff_Combat_Bot

Flyff Combat Bot is a free bot for Flyff Universe running on Chrome.

The bot features a fighter and healer mode. Running the bot takes over some mouse and keyboard actions, so you can't run more than one instance per PC.

CONFIG
The bot can be configured from both flyffconfig.cfg and the GUI. The GUI always loads from the config file. Changes in the GUI are currently not saved back in the config file.
Here's an image that explains which config file sections correlate to which GUI items.
